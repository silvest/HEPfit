HEPfit - a Fitting Tool for the Standard Model and Beyond
===========================================================================

version in progress
-------------------

compatible with FeynHiggs v2.11.2 or v2.10.0 only!

HEPfit is a flexible tool which, given the Standard Model or any extension,
allows to:

  - fit the model parameters to a given set of experimental observables
  - obtain fit results for observables
  - obtain predictions for observables

HEPfit can be used:

  - as an executable in Monte Carlo mode, to perform a Bayesian Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo analysis of the given model
  - as an executable in single event mode, to obtain predictions of observables
    for a given point in the parameter space of the model
  - in library mode, to obtain predictions of observables for a given point
    in the parameter space of the model, allowing our computational tool to
    be used in any statistical framework

The Monte Carlo mode is based on the BAT (Bayesian Analysis Toolkit) library.

Availability:
-------------
HEPfit is available from [the HEPfit webpage](http://hepfit.roma1.infn.it/).
See COPYING file for licensing terms.

Installation:
-------------
To compile and install HEPfit, the following have to be availabled installed:
GSL, LoopTools, Boost, ROOT, and BAT. If all these are installed in
the default install prefix (/usr/local) then run the following
commands to install HEPfit into /usr/local:

	./configure
	make -j 4
	make install

To chose a non-default directory where HEPfit will be installed, set
the prefix (default is /usr/local) with --prefix=/custom/install/path
argument to configure. Likewise to set a non-default directory where
BAT, for example, is installed, set the --with-bat=/custom/path
argument to configure. An example is 

	./configure --prefix=/install/path --with-bat=/BATinstall/dir 
	
Read the output of the command 'configure --help' for the list of
options and environment variables that can be passed to configure.

See the INSTALL file for detailed installation instructions.

Support:
--------
There is not yet a manual for HEPfit. For additional information and
contacting the authors, please, consult [the HEPfit
webpage](http://hepfit.roma1.infn.it/).
